## Advancement

### Research Grants
To encourage development of Program components, the Committee will administer a competitive 
grant program directed at academics and private consultants.  The grant will call for the 
submission of a Program modification request (or, in lieu, a detailed discussion on why 
the effort failed to generate a request), but otherwise give the principal investigators 
wide latitude to explore potential improvements.  The research grant program will distribute 
approximately $8 million annually. 

A key motivation for this proposal is the general failure of the technology transfer 
component of existing research grants (e.g., journal articles, conference presentations) 
to efficiently advance practice.  Proposed modifications to the Program's framework 
represent a more useful technology transfer opportunity than existing practice, and the 
acceptance of said modifications a more useful measure of the return on the grant investment.

### Advanced Practice Grants
To encourage alignment with practice and to extract the best ideas from practitioners, 
the Committee will administer a competitive grant program directed at practitioners. 
Grant applicants must be users of the Program’s products (as demonstrated by a published 
planning study) and must deliver a submission of a Program modification request (or, in 
lieu, a detailed discussion on why the effort failed to generate a request). The advanced 
practice grant program will distribute approximately $4 million annually. 

### Funding
The Travel Modeling as Science Program will be expensive – perhaps $20 million or so 
annually once fully implemented.  The Program, however, represents an opportunity for an 
order-of-magnitude improvement on the return on investment over the existing paradigm, in 
which research with a token technology transfer component fails to make consistent, 
meaningful, measurable contributions to practice, and in which practice proceeds along an 
idiosyncratic, largely ad hoc, trajectory towards improvement. 

A proposition guiding this document is that articulating, as a community, a useful way 
forward without fully discussing the fiscal realities is valuable.  As such, this is all 
I will say about funding, aside from noting several realistic funding avenues exist.  If 
this document succeeds in motivating a second iteration of its self, a logical next step 
is a detailed business plan.
