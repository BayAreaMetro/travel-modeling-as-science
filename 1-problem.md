Merriam Webster defines science as “knowledge about or study of the natural world based 
on facts learned through experiments and observation”.  Travel forecasting practice lacks 
a rigorous approach to experimentation.  Progress is therefore difficult to measure, 
e.g., are we better or worse at predicting the mode choice response to a new (to a region) 
public transit technology than we were 20 years ago?  As follows, we cannot confidently 
describe our endeavors as “scientific”.
