Is Travel Modeling Science or Engineering? 

Merriam Webster defines science and engineering as follows:

**[Science](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/science)**:  
> Knowledge about or study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments and observation. 
    
**[Engineering](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/engineering)**:  
> [A] The application of science and mathematics by which the properties of matter and the 
sources of energy in nature are made useful to people.

> [B] The design and manufacture of complex products. 
    
It could be argued that various aspects of travel modeling exists as either a science or 
engineering discipline as follows:

**Science**  

*Aspects of travel modeling that are directly observable and can be empirically tested 
to support a theory*  
 - travel behavior research including psychology, sociology, and behavioral economics
 - traffic flow theory, car following behavior 
 - network analysis 
 - etc.

**Engineering**  

*Aspects of travel modeling that synthesize the science and mathematics into something 
useful to people include:*  
 - ridership forecasting  
 - project level forecasting  
 - discrete choice model estimation results
 - long-range forecasting  
 - toll-road forecasting
 - etc.

What has been historically been described as "travel model development" fits in with Webster's 
second definition of *Engineering*, as *the design and manufacture of complex products:*  
 - discrete choice modeling   
 - agent-based modeling   
 - activity-based travel models  
 - aggregate, four-step travel models  
 - dynamic traffic assignment  
 - static traffic assignment  
 - etc.

**From Science to Engineering**

Travel forecasting practice lacks a rigorous approach to (A) prioritizing advances in science 
that will result in more usefulness to people as well as (B) synthesizing these advances into 
engineering practice.
