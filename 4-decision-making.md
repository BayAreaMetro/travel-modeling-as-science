## Decision-Making
### The Committee
A sub-committee of TRB Committee ADB 40: Travel Forecasting – “Committee”, henceforth – will 
oversee the Program.  The Committee’s duties will include the following:
* Report on Program activities to funders;
* Select contractors to support the Committee’s activities and directives; 
* Oversee research grant programs (see below); 
* Oversee advanced practice grant programs (see below);
* Oversee data collection programs (see below); and,
* Carry out other activities needed for the Program to succeed. 

The Committee will have five members and each will serve a five-year term.  After an 
initial start-up period, the terms will stagger, such that one new member will serve 
on the Committee each year. The Committee will hold open, quarterly meetings. 

### Calendar
The Program will release an updated version of the model framework each year on the first 
day of October. The Program will then receive requests for modifications from the travel 
forecasting community from October to May.  From June to September, the requests will be 
reviewed, consolidated, and incorporated into the subsequent release per the direction of 
the Committee. 

### Test Beds
Contributors must demonstrate the value of their proposed improvements across two regional 
test beds.  The test beds will be the San Francisco Bay Area and the greater Atlanta region. 
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) is the designated metropolitan planning 
organization for the nine-county Bay Area and the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) is the 
MPO for the ten-county Atlanta Region. I suggest these regions for the following reasons:
* Prior and continued commitment to advancing/improving model practice;
* Prior and continued commitment to data collection;
* Prior and continued collaborative efforts;
* Land development diversity;
* Transportation infrastructure diversity (e.g., toll bridges/lanes, public transit technologies);
* Population diversity;
* Presence of major universities; and,
* Presence of significant visitor travel. 

As the program gets underway, a significant effort will be made to establish the best set 
of observed data for every five-year period between 2000 and 2015.  Moving forward, data 
collection efforts will focus on having detailed data at five-year intervals (see 
below).  Proposed model improvements will be assessed across both regions and against 
the full time series of data.  Assessing model performance across space and time should 
guard against (though not completely) over fit models. 

### Data Collection
MTC and ARC have made significant investments in data collection over the past 20 
years. These efforts are part of the motivation for selecting these regions as test beds 
for the Program.  A much richer set of data must be collected to sustain the Program moving 
forward; focused data collection is a key motivation for selecting only two test bed 
cities.  The following data will be collected no fewer than every five years:
* Household surveys;
* On-board transit surveys;
* Parking inventories and prices;
* Visitor surveys;
* Air passenger surveys;
* University surveys;
* Establishment surveys;
* Traffic counts;
* Transit counts; and,
* Other auxiliary data recommended by the Committee.

Where beneficial and cost-effective, passively collected data will be used to augment 
and/or replace the above data products.

### Software Management
The annual model structure/software release will be managed and distributed via an online 
software management system (e.g., GitHub, BitBucket). All of the software will be distributed 
via a permissive, open-source license, and contributing authors will retain ownership of 
the software code. Something akin to GitHub’s “pull request” feature will be used to 
manage suggested improvements and something akin to GitHub’s “issues” feature will be 
used to track and fix bugs. The software will be released with detailed documentation 
and an easy installation package.

The Committee will pay particular attention to the design of software proposals, striving 
to achieve a code base that is fast, legible, and flexible.

### Starting Point
The regional models currently maintained by MTC and ARC are highly similar and were, in 
fact, developed cooperatively. MTC and ARC are also partners in the ActivitySim effort, 
which seeks to develop and support an open-source activity-based modeling platform. The 
existing MTC and ARC models, as applied in the ActivitySim framework, will serve as the 
starting point for the Program.  MTC and ARC will share relevant survey data going back 
to 2000 as well as the relevant simulation inputs and outputs with the community to foster 
Program development. 

Some in our community may believe that the type of activity-based models currently used 
by MTC and ARC are unnecessarily complicated (and others that the models are too simple).  The 
Travel Modeling as Science Program can disregard this type of commentary, as critics will 
now have a systematic means to propose and demonstrate the benefits of simpler (or more 
complex) approaches.
