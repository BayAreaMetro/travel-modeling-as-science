## 2.	Proposed Solution
Merriam Webster defines straw man as “a weak or imaginary argument or opponent that is 
set up to be easily defeated”.  This document puts forward a straw man proposal to address 
the above problem.  My proposal is a straw man and it, therefore, seeks defeat – though 
not without provoking, and only by superior ideas.  This document will succeed if (a) it
 motivates focused discussion and (b) the community calls for a second draft. 
 
### Overview
The remainder of this document introduces and discusses a Travel Modeling as Science 
Program.  The primary product of the Program will be an annual release of a model application 
framework.  The framework will include a model structure that has a demonstrated ability 
to make useful predictions – by useful I mean reasonably accurate, tractable (i.e., the 
response of a policy can be easily and logically traced through the model system), and 
realistic (i.e., the response to a policy is likely to resonate as reasonable and logical 
with decision makers and the interested public).  The framework will include legible and 
fast application software that is flexible enough to encourage expansions/modifications. 
 To use the framework for planning studies, practitioners will be required to prepare the 
relevant input data, re-estimate coefficients (and/or modify specifications, if desired), 
calibrate (i.e., adjust alterative-specific constants to match observed conditions), 
validate (i.e., compare predictions to observations withheld from calibration), and 
test (e.g., against other historical years, to perturbations to specific variables, etc.).   

The travel forecasting community will put forward annual requests to modify the framework 
– both the model structure and the application software.  A sub-committee of 
Transportation Research Board (TRB) Committee ABD40: Travel Forecasting (with administrative 
and technical contractor support) will assess the requests and incorporate demonstrated 
improvements in subsequent releases of the framework.  This annual cycle will continue 
– sometimes with incremental changes (e.g., a bicycle route choice procedure) and sometimes 
with significant ones (e.g., completely new application software).

A hallmark of the Program will be the requirement to demonstrate the value of an improvement 
prior to the improvement’s incorporation into the annual release.  This demonstration will 
be carried out across two regions and several historical years.  Such an approach provides 
the opportunity for travel models to be the formal repositories of what we know to be true 
about traveler behavior.  And it provides the opportunity for the travel forecasting 
community to more fully embrace the scientific method. 

The remainder of this document provides specific Program details.
