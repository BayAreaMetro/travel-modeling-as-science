## Progressing this Proposal
A session at the 2016 TRB Annual Meeting will be devoted to discussing the strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to this straw man program proposal.  Discussants 
are encouraged to suggest other ideas, as well, for either Program components or the Program 
as a whole.  We will seek actionable feedback and determine whether or not discussions on 
this type of Program should continue, asking: is this type of effort both desired and 
feasible?
