## 6 - Progressing this Proposal

### Progress to Date
A session at the 2016 TRB Annual Meeting was devoted to discussing the strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to the original straw man program proposal.  This session generated significant interest as well as raised significant concerns.  

Since the 2016 Annual meeting, multiple groups of stakeholders have held discussions about the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal and how to progress it.

### Next Steps  
Because of the interest generated at the TRB Annual Meeting, a session (or two) at the 2016 Innovations in Travel Modeling Conference in Denver CO will be dedicated to progressing the discussion.
