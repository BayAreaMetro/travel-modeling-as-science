# Travel Modeling as Science

[Joan Walker](http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/walker) and David Ory put together a session (#547) at the [2016 TRB Annual Meeting](http://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting/AnnualMeeting.aspx) entitled *From Ad Hoc to Scientific: A Moderated Discussion on Improving Travel Forecasting Methods.  Prior to the session, the David Ory distributed a straw man proposal for what he called a Travel Modeling as Science Program.  The original version of this document can be found [here](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/travel-modeling-as-science/blob/c2d761e17cc21e4c50462af0cbf8374e3acd4644/working-draft.md)(as markdown) and [here](https://mtcdrive.box.com/travel-modeling-as-science) (as PDF).

The [current version](working-draft.md) of the Travel Model as Science Program Proposal includes modifications from the comments recieved during the 2016 TRB Annual Meeting.  A session at the [2016 Innovations in Travel Modeling Conference](http://www.cvent.com/events/innovations-in-travel-modeling/event-summary-b5513a90f03e41cb8bb94047c1a4e53e.aspx) will continue our dialogue on this topic.
