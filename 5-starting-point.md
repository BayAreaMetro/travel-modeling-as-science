## 5 - Starting Points for Incubated Projects

The organization will be set up to be flexible to the needs of the industry.  We anticipate a wide array of involved stakeholders, who will advocate for a mosaic of complementary projects spanning the many interests and needs of our industry. The board will be in charge of what projects are undertaken.  That said, there are a number of core activities, longstanding needs and suitable example projects that are outlined in this section in order to have more substance in the proposal.

### Potential Core Activities

#### Library

Serve as a clearinghouse of useful planning tools and methods.

#### Training

Teach basic core competency in modern travel analysis skills, through workshops, online materials, and training. An example of the type of training envisioned is the set of trainings developed by the organization Software Carpentry and recently modified by [PSRC](https://github.com/psrc/novice-python). 

#### Research Direction

Direct research funds towards promising research projects.

### Potential Incubated Projects

#### ActivitySim

[ActivitySim](http://github.com/UDST/activitysim) is a collaboratively managed Python codebase that is capable of executing a state of the practice activity-based travel demand model.  It has an active set of core contributors, reviewers, and supporters.

#### Fast-Trips

[Fast-Trips](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/fast-trips) is a collaboratively developed person-based dynamic transit assignment.

#### Regional Travel Modeling as a Science

Develop a research, testing and award system for methods and processes that improve the status quo of regional travel modeling as dictated by a set of defined performance measures and observed data in regional test beds.

#### Regional Test Beds

Support and maintain regional test-bed data sets to enable rigorous testing of our regional modeling tools.


#### Other projects that could be considered

There are a variety of other projects that have considerable user-bases that could also be considered such as:
[GreenSTEP/RSPM](https://github.com/gregorbj/RSPM)
[DTALite](https://sites.google.com/site/dtalite/)
[SynthPop](https://github.com/UDST/synthpop)
[CycleTracks](https://github.com/sfcta/CycleTracks)
[Transit Reliability Toolbox](https://github.com/sfcta/delay_distribution)

### Potential Managed Standards

#### OMX

[Open Matrix Format](https://sites.google.com/site/openmodeldata/)

#### GTFS-Plus

[GTFS-Plus](https://github.com/osplanning-data-standards/GTFS-PLUS) is a transit network specification that is compatible with GTFS tools yet capable of being used for dynamic transit assignment.
